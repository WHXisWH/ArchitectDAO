# Upgrade Summary (2025-08-29)

This summary covers UI/UX enhancements based on user feedback to improve the application's visual identity and usability.

## 1. Login Page Thematic Redesign

- **Blueprint-Style Background:** Replaced the plain gradient background with a dynamic, dark blue "blueprint" grid, reinforcing the architectural theme of the application.
- **Adapted UI for Dark Theme:**
  - All text elements were changed to light colors for high contrast and readability.
  - The login `Card` was updated with a semi-transparent, "frosted glass" effect (`backdrop-blur-md`) and a brighter border to make it stand out from the dark background while maintaining a modern aesthetic.

## 2. NFT Minting Form UI/UX Overhaul

- **Improved File Upload Component:**
  - The standard, browser-default file input was replaced with a custom, user-friendly component.
  - The new design features a large, dashed-border dropzone area, making the file upload action more intuitive and visually clear.
  - This change resolves previous issues with unclear button styling and awkward text wrapping for the selected file name.
- **Translation Updates:** Added new i18n keys (`mint.chooseFile`, `mint.noFileChosen`) in both English and Japanese to support the new UI component.

# Upgrade Summary (2025-08-28)

This summary outlines a series of major UI, UX, and architectural improvements.

## 1. Stage 1: UI Foundation Upgrade with Shadcn/UI

- **Integrated Shadcn/UI:** Manually configured the project to use the Shadcn/UI component library, including setup of `components.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, and `tsconfig.json` path aliases.
- **Replaced Core Components:** Replaced the original, basic UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea`) with their more robust and themeable Shadcn/UI equivalents.
- **Build Fixes:** Resolved numerous dependency and path-aliasing issues to ensure a stable build.

## 2. Stage 2: NFT Minting Workflow Refactoring

- **Multi-Step Wizard:** Refactored the `MintNFTForm` from a single, long form into a user-friendly, three-step wizard:
  1.  File Upload
  2.  Asset Details
  3.  Preview & Mint
- **Improved UX:** This change significantly improves the user experience by reducing cognitive load and guiding the user through the minting process.
- **Enhanced Feedback:** Implemented clearer status feedback for the minting process, including success and error states.

## 3. Stage 3: Marketplace Experience Enhancement

- **Skeleton Loading:** Implemented `Skeleton` components (`NFTCardSkeleton`) to provide an elegant loading state for the marketplace, improving perceived performance.
- **Custom Empty State:** Designed and implemented a visually appealing "empty state" for when the marketplace has no NFTs, including a call-to-action to encourage minting.
- **Refined Logic:** The `Marketplace.tsx` component was refactored to cleanly handle loading, error, empty, and data-filled states.

## 4. Stage 4: Architectural Refactoring to Custom Hooks

- **Separation of Concerns:** Abstracted business logic out of components and into dedicated, reusable custom hooks.
- **`useNFTMint` Hook:** Created to encapsulate all logic related to the NFT minting process (IPFS upload, smart contract call, state management).
- **`useMarketplace` Hook:** Created to handle all logic for fetching NFT listings from the blockchain.
- **Cleaner Components:** As a result, `MintNFTForm.tsx` and `Marketplace.tsx` are now significantly cleaner, primarily responsible for UI rendering and state display, improving maintainability and testability.

# Upgrade Summary (2025-08-27)

This document summarizes the key improvements and changes made to the ArchitectDAO application.

## 1. Code Cleanup & Refinement

- **Removed Redundant UI Text:** Removed unnecessary "advertisement-like" descriptions, taglines, and feature lists from the following components to create a cleaner and more focused user interface:
  - `HomePage.tsx`
  - `LoginPage.tsx`
  - `Header.tsx`
  - `Footer.tsx`
  - `MintNFTForm.tsx`
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Resolved a build error in `Marketplace.tsx` by using the correct properties (`nameKey`, `descriptionKey`) for NFT assets and implementing translation for searching.
  - Fixed several "unused import" errors that arose after removing UI elements.

## 2. UI Improvement Plan Implementation

Based on the proposed plan, the following enhancements have been implemented:

### a. Layout & Spacing

- Increased the padding within all `Card` components (`CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`) from `p-6` to `p-8` to improve visual "breathing room".

### b. Component Polish

- **Card:**
  - Updated box-shadow from `shadow-sm` to `shadow-lg` for a more pronounced look.
  - Enhanced the hover effect with `hover:shadow-xl` and a subtle lift (`hover:-translate-y-1`).
- **Button:**
  - Added a subtle lift (`hover:-translate-y-0.5`) and an active state (`active:scale-95`) to provide better visual feedback on interaction.
- **Input & Textarea:**
  - Enhanced the focus state by adding a soft ring (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-toda-blue/20`), making it clearer which field is active.

### c. Typography

- **Created a Unified System:** A new `src/typography.css` file was created to define a consistent set of typography classes (`.h1`, `.h2`, `.h3`, `.h4`, `.body`, `.body-lg`, `.caption`).
- **Applied Consistently:** These classes were applied across the application's components to ensure a consistent and hierarchical typographic scale.

### d. Color Palette

- **Modernized Colors:** The color palette in `tailwind.config.js` was updated with softer, more modern shades:
  - `toda-blue`: `#5A87D4`
  - `toda-red`: `#FF7A59`
  - `toda-grey`: `#A0AEC0`
- **Added Accent Color:** A new light blue accent color (`toda-light-blue`: `#F0F4F8`) was added to the theme for future use.

## 3. Smart Contract Deployment
